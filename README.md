# Socket-DB
Socket-DB is a lightweight client-server database system written in C, designed to demonstrate network programming and custom database management over TCP/IP sockets. It supports basic SQL-like operations (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, SAVE, LOAD) with remote table synchronization between client(Windows) and multi-threaded server(Linux).
